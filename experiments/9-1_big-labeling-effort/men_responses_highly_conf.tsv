M	Do you really think that a WWIII between Russia and the US would have been a better alternative to the Cold War?	What kind of world is it where WW3 is going to be started?
M	Isnt part of the NFLPA dues supposed to go into a fund that will protect players like that in event of a strike?	No, that's part of the pension plan, which is why the NFLPA is making their cut. The strike would most likely still occur, I highly doubt they'll offer pension benefits.

M	Didnt the aggregates of the polls in the primaries show Bernie winning against Trump in the General, but Hilary losing to him?	The polls were on a Clinton win in the general, but he won the popular vote by double digits. But if that's how you've been interpreting the numbers, it was skewed
M	Dont you just love all these hateful, alt-right accounts that are all under 6 months old telling you whats going on in Europe?	Oh, stop trolling, you scummy screem.

M	do you think that the tax-free compounding of UIL is valuable enough to offset the high startup fees of UIL, as well as the reduced gains in interest, versus a taxable brokerage account + term life insurance?	No, especially if ui's were just added and or not a part of UIL.
